# Tech Resume Checklist

This checklist serves as concrete (but not complete) criteria that a resume for the tech industry should fulfill. It was originally designed for student organizations hoping to host resume critiques: have your reviewees check off all these items before coming to the critique so more time can be devoted to meaningful feedback.

A lot of useful tips were excluded due to their subjectivitiy. This way, there should be no discussion on whether or not your resume should tick a box. More detailed tips and explanations for all the checklist items can be found in this [“Resume Tips” document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rIcPf0HxjhHT9nZPqRGgzvPDn1CoFBWDsfJ-jpbVQyw), which was created and refined over time by experienced UWaterloo students.

Please feel free to open an issue to discuss any of these points or a PR to add/change/remove points!

### Content Checklist:
- [ ] Contains the key sections/information: Experience, Relevant Projects, Education, and Contact information
    -  A Skills section is optional depending on the role. General roles likely don't need one, specific roles (e.g. React Developer) probably do.
- [ ] No soft skills in the Skills section. They say nothing: anyone can claim to be good at “communication” or “critical thinking”. You should demonstrate these skills through your bullet points in your experience section.
- [ ] No Summary of Qualifications. Your whole resume should be the summary!
- [ ] Experience includes your title, company, dates worked, and (optionally) location
- [ ] For contact information, include your email and (optionally) links to your personal website, GitHub account, and LinkedIn
    - Unless the role asks for it, you don't need to include your physical address
- [ ] Resume is catered to the role. This can be as simple as re-ordering/selecting relevant skills and projects.
- [ ] Bullet points describe **impact** not just **responsibilities** (i.e. what was the result of your work, not just what your work was). The reader should also understand _why_ your work was important to the company/project. 
    - Basic template: _\<quantified impact\>_ [by/through/via] _\<what you did/how you did it\>_, _\<why it matters to org\>_  
        - Of course, this structure won’t work for all points
    - Quantified impact could be: reduced time needed to y from x to z, deployed feature with x% higher user satisfaction (you can get this info via a/b tests), improved latency/throughput by x%, acquired x new users, etc. 
        - What you did (hopefully) had _some_ impact, otherwise you wouldn’t have been paid to do it. 


### Format Checklist:
- [ ] Resume is one page max.
- [ ] For a one column resume, each bullet should be 2 lines max (3 lines max for a two column resume)
- [ ] No text has font size smaller than 10.
- [ ] Resume should be accessible and clear, even when printed in greyscale (no dark backgrounds, light text on light backgrounds, complex color patterns, etc).
- [ ] All links you have are clickable and not just plaintext .
- [ ] **Bolded** technologies/tools in your bullet points. This makes it easier for recruiters to see that you've actually used the tools/tech you claim to in your Skills section.
- [ ] Ensure capitalization is consistent throughout your resume, especially for the names of tools/technologies.
- [ ] All dates and date ranges use a consistent format (e.g. mmm yyyy - mmm yyyy as in May 2020 - Aug 2020).
- [ ] No acronyms unless they are listed in the job description (or are _very_ common)
- [ ] Whitespace is balanced. If one section (e.g. skills, awards) is a bullet point list on the left side, consider making it a flat comma separated list or use two columns for just that section for visual balance.


### Optional Checklist (don't have to check all of these off):
- [ ] Bold achievements/recognition/metrics in your experience/projects. This is optional because you may have too much bold when combined with bolded tech/tools, so be wary of that.
- [ ] If you have relevant experience/projects, put that above your education (but this depends on the role!).
- [ ] Remove or greatly reduce your Relevant Courses section. 
    - You probably don’t want to include mandatory courses for your major, since your major implies you learned those things. 
    - Specialized electives may be relevant, but it’s always better to demonstrate those skills via a project.
- [ ] Use between 1-4 bullet points per experience/project
    - Exception: when you only have one or two relevant experiences/projects, you _MIGHT_ want to use more bullets to emphasize those.
- [ ] Reorder recent experience (\<2 years) to put the most relevant experience on top for the role you’re applying to.
